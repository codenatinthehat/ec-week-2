<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A mojito is a refreshing and iconic Cuban cocktail that combines the crisp flavors of mint, lime, and rum. To make this delightful drink, start by muddling the fresh mint leaves and lime wedges in a glass with a touch of sugar to release their essential oils and juices. Next, add a generous pour of white rum and fill the glass with ice cubes. Top it off with a splash of sparkling water and gently stir to marry the flavors.</p>
<p>The resulf is a refreshing mix of zesty citrus, cooling mint, and the subtle warmth of rum, making the mojito the perfect drink to enjoy on a hot summer day. Garnish with a sprig of fresh mint and a lime wheel for that extra touch of elegance, and sip away.</p>
